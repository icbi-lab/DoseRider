Version: 1.0.5
Authors@R: c(person("Pablo", "Monfort-Lanzas", email = "pablo.monfort@i-med.ac.at", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Provides tools for analyzing dose-response relationships in gene expression data using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs). It is useful for modeling the relationship between gene expression and dose levels of various compounds, identifying dose-response patterns, and extracting breakpoints. This package aids in studying the impact of chemical compounds on gene expression profiles and assessing potential toxicological risks.
