\title{Compute IC50 from SummarizedExperiment object}
\usage{
compute_IC50(se, dose_col, viability_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A `SummarizedExperiment` object containing the dose-response data.}

\item{dose_col}{A string representing the name of the column in `colData` that contains the dose information.}

\item{viability_col}{A string representing the name of the column in `colData` that contains the viability or response data.}
}
\value{
A named vector of IC50 values for each gene, where the names are the gene identifiers.
}
\description{
This function computes the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) for each gene
in a given `SummarizedExperiment` object based on the dose-response relationship.
The function takes the name of the dose column and the viability column (response)
from the `colData` and returns a vector of IC50 values.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `se` is a SummarizedExperiment object with dose and viability information
# ic50_values <- compute_IC50(se, dose_col = "dose", viability_col = "viability")
