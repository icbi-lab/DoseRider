\title{Filter Gene Sets in a GMT File by Specific IDs}
\usage{
filter_gmt_by_id(gmt, vector_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmt}{A list representing the GMT file's data.
Each element of the list is expected to be a gene set, which is itself a list with an `external_id` field.}

\item{vector_id}{A vector of IDs (as character strings or numeric values).
Gene sets whose `external_id` matches any of these IDs will be retained in the output.}
}
\value{
A list of gene sets from the GMT file that match the specified IDs.
        This list will only contain elements where the `external_id` matched at least one of the IDs in `vector_id`.
        If no matches are found, an empty list is returned.
}
\description{
This function filters gene sets contained within a GMT file based on a given vector of IDs. 
It checks each gene set for a matching `external_id` and retains only those that match any of the provided IDs.
}
\note{
This function does not handle cases where `external_id` is missing in the gene sets.
      It is assumed that each gene set in the GMT has a valid `external_id` field.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `gmt_data` is a list representing a GMT file
# and you want to filter for gene sets with external IDs 101 and 102:
filtered_data <- filter_gmt_by_id(gmt_data, c(101, 102))

}
