\title{Compute Derivatives and Identify Zero Points}
\usage{
compute_derivatives(smooth_pathway, dose_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{smooth_pathway}{Data frame containing smoothed trend predictions, typically from a dose-response model.}

\item{dose_var}{The name of the dose variable in `smooth_pathway`.}
}
\value{
A list containing the first derivative, second derivative, and
        the zero points for both first and second derivatives.
}
\description{
This function calculates the first and second derivatives of the predicted
values from a mixed model and identifies points where these derivatives
are approximately zero.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
smooth_pathway <- data.frame(Dose = c(0, 1, 2, 3), predictions = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.2))
derivatives <- compute_derivatives(smooth_pathway, "Dose")
print(derivatives)
